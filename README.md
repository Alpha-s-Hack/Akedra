## Akedra — Decentralized Credential Vault

**Akedra** empowers displaced, refugee, and underserved students by providing a secure, blockchain-backed platform for issuing, storing, and verifying educational credentials that travel seamlessly across borders.

## 🌍 Mission

Millions of students in conflict zones, refugee camps, and rural areas lose access to their academic records. Akedra offers a tamper-proof, decentralized vault for verifiable credentials — giving students ownership of their educational identity no matter where life takes them.

## 🚀 Features

- **Credential Uploader**  
  Schools and teachers can upload academic certificates (.pdf, .jpeg) securely.

- **Verification Endpoint**  
  External organizations verify credentials via QR code scans or NFT-like token checks.

  Off-chain metadata and timestamps are securely stored in Bolt DB for fast access.

- **Multi-language AI Advisor**  
  Powered by Tavus and ElevenLabs, provides scholarship and career advice in local languages.
